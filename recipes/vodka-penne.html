    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Penne alla vodka is a pasta dish made primarily with vodka and penne,
      usually accompanied with heavy cream, crushed tomatoes or tomato sauce,
      onions, and sometimes small meats and vegetables such as sausage, pancetta
      or peas. The alcohol is said to intensify and accentuate flavors in the
      dish.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
      <li>1 banana shallot or ½ onion, finely chopped</li>
      <li>3 garlic cloves, crushed</li>
      <li>¼ tsp chilli flakes</li>
      <li>100g tomato purée</li>
      <li>5 tbsp vodka</li>
      <li>100ml double cream</li>
      <li>200g penne or rigatoni</li>
      <li>
        pasta 30g grated parmesan or vegetarian alternative, plus extra to serve
      </li>
      <li>small handful of basil leaves, to serve</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>

      <li>
        Heat the oil in a large frying pan or casserole dish. Add the shallot
        and a large pinch of salt and gently fry over a low heat for 10 mins or
        until softened and translucent. Add the garlic and chilli flakes and
        cook for 30 seconds. Stir through the tomato purée, cook for 2 mins,
        then stir through the vodka and cook for 3 mins. Quickly stir through
        the cream to combine, then remove from the heat.
      </li>

        Cook the pasta in salted water following pack instructions. Drain and
        reserve 150ml cooking water. Add roughly 50ml of the water to the tomato
        sauce, then tip in the pasta and cheese, tossing everything together
        over a low heat until well coated and glossy (loosen with a splash more
        of the cooking water if it is a little dry). Season to taste, then serve
        with a sprinkling of the extra parmesan, a good grinding of black pepper
        and the basil leaves scattered over the top.
