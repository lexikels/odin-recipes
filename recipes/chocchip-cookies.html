      <li>1/2 cup Sugar</li>
      <li>2 Eggs</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups Cake Flour*</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups Flour</li>

      <li>2 cups Chocolate Chips</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 210 degrees celcius.</li>
      <li>
        In a large mixing bowl, cream together cold cubed butter, brown sugar,
        and sugar for 4 minutes or until creamy.
      </li>
      <li>Add eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each one.</li>
      <li>
        Stir in flours, cornstarch, baking soda, and salt. Mix until just
        combined to avoid overmixing. Stir in chocolate chips and walnuts.
      </li>
      <li>
        Separate dough into large balls and place on lightly colored cookie
        sheet. They are bigger than you think! You will fit 4 cookies on one
        large cookie sheet. The dough makes 8 extra large cookies.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake for 9-12 minutes or until golden brown on the top. Let them rest
        for at least 10 minutes to set.
      </li>
    </ol>
